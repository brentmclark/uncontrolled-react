## About Uncontrolled

Uncontrolled is a form component designed to complement use of HTML5 form fields and validation.  There is no state management, no form field/control libraries to mess with, and no validation.  

Why?

Because HTML has already done that for you and using the native HTML form fields (and validation) is incredibly simple.  Check out the example below if you're skeptical.  It's got state management and validaton baked in.
